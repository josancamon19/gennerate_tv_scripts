## Generate TV Scripts

This is the third project of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.

In this project, I built my own Recurrent Networks and Long Short-Term Memory Networks with
PyTorch. I performed sentiment analysis and generate new text, and used recurrent networks to generate
new text that resembles a training set of TV scripts.
